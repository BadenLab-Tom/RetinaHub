The first iteration of Retina Hub is live and ready to receive entries!

Retina hub is a user driven paper database for the retina field. 

The idea is simple: 

Given the number of papers, it is hard to keep track of all publications, filter them based on sub areas.

To help with this, we set up a website to aggregate papers. The website allows for papers to be searched and filtered using keywords.

To create a robust database, we created a form users can use to submit papers. After a quick spam check, the papers are added to the website. 

A shout out to the folks from [Open Neuroscience](https://open-neuroscience.com). We created this website based on their development stack.
